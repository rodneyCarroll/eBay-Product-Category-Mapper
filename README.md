## Introduction
The **eBay Product Category Mapper** automates product-to-category mapping by leveraging the eBay API and local AI-based matching models. Sellers often waste hours manually choosing categories for each product — this automation eliminates that step by analyzing keywords, item specifics, and product metadata in real time.

### Automating eBay Category Classification
- Automatically identifies the correct eBay category for new or bulk product listings.  
- Reduces manual errors and rejections caused by incorrect category mapping.  
- Enhances listing visibility and improves SEO ranking inside eBay.  
- Integrates directly into listing workflows or automation pipelines.

## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation starts when a new product list or CSV file is uploaded through the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** — Each product’s title, brand, and attributes are parsed and sent through AI-based NLP models and eBay category APIs.  
3. **Category Assignment** — The most relevant category ID is automatically assigned and validated through the eBay taxonomy endpoint.  
4. **Output or Action** — The final category mappings are applied directly to listings or exported for use in other automation workflows.  
5. **Other Functionalities** — Advanced logging, feedback loops, and performance metrics ensure reliable classification and easy debugging.
